# Class 4 - Templates and Typography

## Daily Plan
1. Code Review
2. Typography
3. RegEx Intro
3. Templates

Templates have some advantages over direct DOM manipulation. Leverage those strengths in the blog, and in your portfolio application!

As we get more sophisticated, this is a good time to ensure our CSS styles are well organized. We'll follow the SMACSS system for keeping everything in it's proper place.

 Class Notes:

 Regex
 Regular Expressions - got to practice to learn how they work; not regular in practice
 select Javascript; used for validation; parsing strings, matching things, input validation
 Can put flags on last slash - Regular Expression Flags (g, i, m)
 Can put naked characters that will be treated literally

 ex. we are going to validate a phone number
  should add global
  or - can use ?,

  ex. var author = 'Will Skelton' (for a website)
  author.replace(\s/, '_') - now can use in a URL

  string.protype.replace() - this is slugging (removing spaces)

  Typography - UI, UX
  Text as soon as it becomes visual; letters on the page
  pay attention in reading material to:
  - point matches a pixel
  - spacing

  Templating

  Templating engines - super common; we will focus on client side templating (will do in the browser and html when it loads; predefine html document, gets sent back with data that gets renderd; advantage is that the document is the same though data may change) vs. server side (base document, manipulate server side and send unique document)

  new syntax and library
